      <p><em><strong>Web Developer</strong>.</em></p>
      <p>I am a full stack web developer. I spend most of my day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred Twitter feeds.
        I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can
        meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p></td>
